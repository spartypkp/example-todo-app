# This application requires NO environment variables! ðŸŽ‰

# The only environment variable used is NODE_ENV which is 
# automatically set by Next.js:
# - 'development' when running `npm run dev`
# - 'production' when running `npm run build && npm start`

# Everything else is self-contained:
# - SQLite database is stored locally as 'todos.db'
# - No external services or API keys needed
# - Sessions use simple cookies, no JWT secrets required
